Completing this thesis has been an incredible journey, and I am deeply grateful to everyone who has been a part of it. I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Timothy D. Wilkinson, without whose encouragement I wouldn't even hit the `apply' button for a PhD study; my parents, for always being proud of me; my wife, Mingyue Liu, for her unwavering love and belief in me; my colleagues at CMMPE, Daoming, Fan, Peter, Ralf, Andrew, Youchao, Yue, Jana, Amr, Miguel, Ben, Oana, Roubing, Zhongling, Dilawer, Antoni, Yutaka and Solomon, for all the useful discussions and fun times together in Cambridge, Tim's farm, and conference sites around the world; my King's College friends, Jianghan and Yidong, without whom my cooking, cycling, mahjong and snooker skills wouldn't have soared; and my high school deskmate, Yiwei Chen, without whom my gaming skills wouldn't have improved.
