These uncorrelated kinoforms are recorded and read out sequentially by a phase-only liquid-crystal spatial light modulator, and reconstructed images with well-developed speckles are added. The fidelity of the resultant image to an original is improved as the number of additions increases. The dependence of the speckle contrast on the initial random phase and the influence of the liquid-crystal spatial light modulator's display performance on the image quality are discussed.},

The target projector is first calibrated using an automated adaptive-optical mechanism. The calibration parameters are then fed into the hologram generation program, which applies a novel piece-wise aberration correction algorithm. The method is found to offer hologram generation times up to three orders of magnitude faster than the standard method. A projection of an aberration- and distortion-free image with a field of view of 90x45 degrees is demonstrated. The implementation on a mid-range GPU achieves high resolution at a frame rate up to 12fps. The presented methods are automated and can be performed on any holographic projector.},

We demonstrate that its ability to record curvature information enables L-BFGS to have good quality imbalance suppression under the SS technique.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems. © 1989 North-Holland.},

   abstract = {Recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM) have become an increasingly popular choice for state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. RNNLMs are normally trained by minimizing the cross entropy (CE) using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. The SGD method only uses first-order derivatives and no higher order gradient information is used to consider the correlation between model parameters. It is unable to fully capture the curvature of the error cost function. This can lead to slow convergence in model training. In this paper, a limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon (L-BFGS) based second order optimization technique is proposed for RNNLMs. This method efficiently approximates the matrix-vector product between the inverse Hessian and gradient vector via a recursion over past gradients with a compact memory requirement. Consistent perplexity and error rate reductions are obtained over the SGD method on two speech recognition tasks: Switchboard English and Babel Cantonese. A faster convergence and speed up in RNNLM training time was also obtained.

Temporal coherence is related to the intrinsic spectrum bandwidth of the light source, while spatial coherence can be affected by the size of the light source and propagation distance in use. These two coherence properties are measured for various light sources of diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser, laser diode (LD), light emitting diode (LED), super luminescent light emitting diode (sLED) and micro light emitting diode (mLED) in different settings, together with the quality of the holographic reconstructed images. Although the image sharpness and speckle are related to both coherence parameters, our results and subsequent analysis show that the spatial coherence can be linked directly to the image sharpness and the temporal coherence to the speckle. This will provide a quantitative way not only to optimize the image quality between uniformity and sharpness but also to determine the safety power level for different light sources when viewing the produced images by human eyes directly.},

However, due to their long spatial coherence length lasers are inappropriate for such applications as they produce coherent noise and parasitic reflections, such as speckle, degrading image quality. Therefore, we provide a step-by-step guide for constructing a speckle-free and high contrast laser illumination setup using a rotating ground glass diffuser driven by a stepper motor. The setup is easy to build, cheap and allows a significant light throughput of 48 %, which is 40 % higher in comparison to a single lens collector commonly used in reported setups. This is achieved by using only one objective to collect the scattered light from the ground glass diffuser. We validate the stability and performance of our setup in terms of image quality, motor-induced vibrations and light throughput. To highlight the latter, we record Brownian motion of micro-particles using a 100x oil immersion objective and a high-speed camera operating at 2 000 Hz with a laser output power of only 22 mW. Moreover, by reducing the objective magnification to 50x sampling rates up to 10 000 Hz are realized. To help readers with basic or advanced optics knowledge realizing this setup we provide; a full component list, 3D-printing CAD files, setup protocol, and the code for running the stepper motor.},

                    SGD (Stochastic gradient descent) is an emerging technique for achieving high-fidelity projected images in CGH (computer-generated holography) display systems. For real-world applications, the devices to display the corresponding holographic fringes have limited bit-depth depending on the specific display technology employed. SGD performance is adversely affected by this limitation and in this piece of work we quantitatively compare the impact on algorithmic performance based on different bit-depths by developing our own algorithm, Q-SGD (Quantised-SGD). The choice of modulation device is a key decision in the design of a given holographic display systems and the research goal here is to better inform the selection and application of individual display technologies.},

   abstract = {The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method is useful in the phase-only hologram optimization process and can achieve a high-quality holographic display. However, for the current SGD solution in multi-depth hologram generation, the optimization time increases dramatically as the number of depth layers of object increases, leading to the SGD method nearly impractical in hologram generation of the complicated three-dimensional object. In this paper, the proposed method uses a complex loss function instead of an amplitude-only loss function in the SGD optimization process. This substitution ensures that the total loss function can be obtained through only one calculation, and the optimization time can be reduced hugely. Moreover, since both the amplitude and phase parts of the object are optimized, the proposed method can obtain a relatively accurate complex amplitude distribution. The defocus blur effect is therefore matched with the result from the complex amplitude reconstruction. Numerical simulations and optical experiments have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

If the system is discretized onto a regular array, Fast Fourier techniques can speed up the resulting calculations but if high spatial resolution is required the initial step of discretization can limit performance; at other times the discretized methods result in unacceptable artifacts in the resulting transform. An alternative approach is to calculate the full Fourier integral transform of a polygonal area as a sum over the vertices, which has previously been derived in the literature using the divergence theorem to reduce the problem from a 3-dimensional to line integrals over the perimeter of the polygon surface elements, and converted to a sum over the straight segments of that contour. We demonstrate a software implementation of this algorithm and show that it can provide accurate approximations of the Fourier transform of real shapes with faster convergence than a block-based (voxel) discretization.},

Computer-g enerated holography avoids the interferometric recording step in conventional hologram formation. Instead, a computer calculates a holographic fringe pattern that it then uses to set the optical properties of a spatial light modulator, such as a liquid crystal microdisplay. The SLM then diffracts the readout light wave, in a manner similar to a standard hologram, to yield the desired optical wavefront. Although CGH-based display systems can be built today, their high cost makes them impractical for many applications.

            Abstract
             In a computer-generated holographic projection system, the image is reconstructed via the diffraction of light from a spatial light modulator. In this process, several factors could contribute to non-linearities between the reconstructed and the target image. This paper evaluates the non-linearity of the overall holographic projection system experimentally, using binary phase holograms computed using the one-step phase retrieval (OSPR) algorithm, and then applies a digital pre-distortion (DPD) method to correct for the non-linearity. Both a notable increase in reconstruction quality and a significant reduction in mean squared error were observed, proving the effectiveness of the proposed DPD-OSPR algorithm.

Current driver assistance systems such as 2D head-up displays are limited to the projection area on the windshield of the car. An augmented reality holographic point cloud video projection system is developed to display objects aligned with real-life objects in size and distance within the driver's field of view. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data collected with a 3D laser scanner is transformed into layered 3D replay field objects consisting of 400 k points. GPU-accelerated computing generated real-time holograms 16.6 times faster than the CPU processing time. The holographic projections are obtained with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) (3840×2160 px) and virtual Fresnel lenses, which enlarged the driver's eye box to 25 mm × 36 mm. Real-time scanned road obstacles from different perspectives provide the driver a full view of risk factors such as generated depth in 3D mode and the ability to project any scanned object from different angles in 360°. The 3D holographic projection technology allows for maintaining the driver's focus on the road instead of the windshield and enables assistance by projecting road obstacles hidden from the driver's field of view.},
