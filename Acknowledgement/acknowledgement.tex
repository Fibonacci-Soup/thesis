Completing this thesis has been an incredible journey, and I am deeply grateful to everyone who has been a part of it. I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Timothy D. Wilkinson, without whose encouragement I wouldn't even hit the `apply' button for PhD study; my parents, for always being proud of me and supporting me all the way; my wife, Mingyue Liu, for her unwavering love and belief in me; my colleagues at CMMPE, Daoming, Fan, Peter, Ralf, Andrew, Youchao, Yue, Jana, Amr, Miguel, Ben, Oana, Roubing, Zhongling, Dilawer, Antoni, Yutaka, and Solomon, for all the useful discussions and fun times together; my King's College friends, Jianghan and Yidong, without whom my cooking, cycling, mahjong, and snooker skills wouldn't have soared; and my high school deskmate, Yiwei Chen, for distracting me from studying to play computer games every day.
