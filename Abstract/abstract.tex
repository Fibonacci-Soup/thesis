    % This thesis explores the development and optimisation of phase-only holograms for computer-generated holography (CGH) with the goal of achieving high-quality three-dimensional displays. We investigate several phase retrieval algorithms, including the Naive method, Direct Binary Search (DBS), Simulated Annealing (SA), Gerchberg-Saxton (GS), and One-Step Phase Retrieval (OSPR). Our comparative analysis reveals that the GS algorithm provides a robust and efficient approach for generating phase-only holograms, though its iterative nature poses challenges for real-time applications.

    % The OSPR algorithm, with its time-multiplexing strategy, effectively reduces noise in the reconstructed images, enhancing the visual quality. Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in achieving real-time, high-fidelity holographic displays. Future research directions include the development of real-time phase retrieval algorithms, advanced noise reduction techniques, and enhancements in spatial light modulator (SLM) technology.

    % Our findings contribute to the field of holography by providing insights into the strengths and limitations of current phase retrieval methods and by outlining pathways for future innovations that could lead to practical, high-quality holographic displays for various applications, including augmented and virtual reality.
