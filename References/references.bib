  abstract = {Abstract Light Blue Optics' holographic laser projection technology exploits the physical process of two-dimensional diffraction to form video images. Such a method of image projection and display has long been desired, but was never previously realised, due to computational complexity and the poor quality of the resultant images. LBO's approach represents an entirely new approach to hologram generation and display, matched to human visual perceptive factors, which overcomes both of these problems enabling — for the first time — a high quality, real-time holographic projector.},

  abstract = {In 1948, Dennis Gabor proposed the concept of holography, providing a pioneering solution to a quantitative description of the optical wavefront. After 75 years of development, holographic imaging has become a powerful tool for optical wavefront measurement and quantitative phase imaging. The emergence of this technology has given fresh energy to physics, biology, and materials science. Digital holography (DH) possesses the quantitative advantages of wide-field, non-contact, precise, and dynamic measurement capability for complex-waves. DH has unique capabilities for the propagation of optical fields by measuring light scattering with phase information. It offers quantitative visualization of the refractive index and thickness distribution of weak absorption samples, which plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of various diseases and the characterization of various materials. It provides a possibility to bridge the gap between the imaging and scattering disciplines. The propagation of wavefront is described by the complex amplitude. The complex-value in the complex-domain is reconstructed from the intensity-value measurement by camera in the real-domain. Here, we regard the process of holographic recording and reconstruction as a transformation between complex-domain and real-domain, and discuss the mathematics and physical principles of reconstruction. We review the DH in underlying principles, technical approaches, and the breadth of applications. We conclude with emerging challenges and opportunities based on combining holographic imaging with other methodologies that expand the scope and utility of holographic imaging even further. The multidisciplinary nature brings technology and application experts together in label-free cell biology, analytical chemistry, clinical sciences, wavefront sensing, and semiconductor production.},

The target projector is first calibrated using an automated adaptive-optical mechanism. The calibration parameters are then fed into the hologram generation program, which applies a novel piece-wise aberration correction algorithm. The method is found to offer hologram generation times up to three orders of magnitude faster than the standard method. A projection of an aberration- and distortion-free image with a field of view of 90x45 degrees is demonstrated. The implementation on a mid-range GPU achieves high resolution at a frame rate up to 12fps. The presented methods are automated and can be performed on any holographic projector.}

Instead of computing the full 3D reconstruction of the hologram, we use a novel method using L-BFGS with sequential slicing (SS) for partial evaluation of the hologram during optimization that only computes loss for a single slice of the reconstruction at every iteration. We demonstrate that its ability to record curvature information enables L-BFGS to have good quality imbalance suppression under the SS technique.}

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems. © 1989 North-Holland.},

RNNLMs are normally trained by minimizing the cross entropy (CE) using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. The SGD method only uses first-order derivatives and no higher order gradient information is used to consider the correlation between model parameters. It is unable to fully capture the curvature of the error cost function. This can lead to slow convergence in model training. In this paper, a limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon (L-BFGS) based second order optimization technique is proposed for RNNLMs. This method efficiently approximates the matrix-vector product between the inverse Hessian and gradient vector via a recursion over past gradients with a compact memory requirement. Consistent perplexity and error rate reductions are obtained over the SGD method on two speech recognition tasks: Switchboard English and Babel Cantonese. A faster convergence and speed up in RNNLM training time was also obtained.

  abstract  = {Coherence properties of different light sources and how they affect the image quality of holographic display are investigated. Temporal coherence is related to the intrinsic spectrum bandwidth of the light source, while spatial coherence can be affected by the size of the light source and propagation distance in use. These two coherence properties are measured for various light sources of diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser, laser diode (LD), light emitting diode (LED), super luminescent light emitting diode (sLED) and micro light emitting diode (mLED) in different settings, together with the quality of the holographic reconstructed images. Although the image sharpness and speckle are related to both coherence parameters, our results and subsequent analysis show that the spatial coherence can be linked directly to the image sharpness and the temporal coherence to the speckle. This will provide a quantitative way not only to optimize the image quality between uniformity and sharpness but also to determine the safety power level for different light sources when viewing the produced images by human eyes directly.},

  abstract  = {Wide field-of-view imaging of fast processes in a microscope requires high light intensities motivating the use of lasers as light sources. However, due to their long spatial coherence length lasers are inappropriate for such applications as they produce coherent noise and parasitic reflections, such as speckle, degrading image quality. Therefore, we provide a step-by-step guide for constructing a speckle-free and high contrast laser illumination setup using a rotating ground glass diffuser driven by a stepper motor. The setup is easy to build, cheap and allows a significant light throughput of 48 %, which is 40 % higher in comparison to a single lens collector commonly used in reported setups. This is achieved by using only one objective to collect the scattered light from the ground glass diffuser. We validate the stability and performance of our setup in terms of image quality, motor-induced vibrations and light throughput. To highlight the latter, we record Brownian motion of micro-particles using a 100x oil immersion objective and a high-speed camera operating at 2 000 Hz with a laser output power of only 22 mW. Moreover, by reducing the objective magnification to 50x sampling rates up to 10 000 Hz are realized. To help readers with basic or advanced optics knowledge realizing this setup we provide; a full component list, 3D-printing CAD files, setup protocol, and the code for running the stepper motor.},

               SGD (Stochastic gradient descent) is an emerging technique for achieving high-fidelity projected images in CGH (computer-generated holography) display systems. For real-world applications, the devices to display the corresponding holographic fringes have limited bit-depth depending on the specific display technology employed. SGD performance is adversely affected by this limitation and in this piece of work we quantitatively compare the impact on algorithmic performance based on different bit-depths by developing our own algorithm, Q-SGD (Quantised-SGD). The choice of modulation device is a key decision in the design of a given holographic display systems and the research goal here is to better inform the selection and application of individual display technologies.},

However, for the current SGD solution in multi-depth hologram generation, the optimization time increases dramatically as the number of depth layers of object increases, leading to the SGD method nearly impractical in hologram generation of the complicated three-dimensional object. In this paper, the proposed method uses a complex loss function instead of an amplitude-only loss function in the SGD optimization process. This substitution ensures that the total loss function can be obtained through only one calculation, and the optimization time can be reduced hugely. Moreover, since both the amplitude and phase parts of the object are optimized, the proposed method can obtain a relatively accurate complex amplitude distribution. The defocus blur effect is therefore matched with the result from the complex amplitude reconstruction. Numerical simulations and optical experiments have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

If the system is discretized onto a regular array, Fast Fourier techniques can speed up the resulting calculations but if high spatial resolution is required the initial step of discretization can limit performance; at other times the discretized methods result in unacceptable artifacts in the resulting transform. An alternative approach is to calculate the full Fourier integral transform of a polygonal area as a sum over the vertices, which has previously been derived in the literature using the divergence theorem to reduce the problem from a 3-dimensional to line integrals over the perimeter of the polygon surface elements, and converted to a sum over the straight segments of that contour. We demonstrate a software implementation of this algorithm and show that it can provide accurate approximations of the Fourier transform of real shapes with faster convergence than a block-based (voxel) discretization.},

In this review, we discuss the basic principles of analog and digital holography and the various topics mentioned above, with selected applications to real-world problems. We also discuss other related topics such as dynamic holography, non-Bragg orders, and compressive holographic tomography, nonlinear holography, holographic TV, as well as a nonholographic technique for 3D visualization, viz., transport of intensity imaging. Finally, we expose interested readers to contemporary topics in the area, viz., nonlinear holography and real-time holographic TV.},

@article{Slinger2005,
  abstract = {Invented in 1947 by Dennis Gabor holography-from the Greek holos, for whole-is a 3D display technique that involves using interference and diffraction to record and reconstruct optical wavefronts. Holography's unique ability to generate accurately both the amplitude and phase of fight waves enables applications beyond those limited by the light manipulations capabilities of lens- or mirror-based systems. Computer-g enerated holography avoids the interferometric recording step in conventional hologram formation. Instead, a computer calculates a holographic fringe pattern that it then uses to set the optical properties of a spatial light modulator, such as a liquid crystal microdisplay. The SLM then diffracts the readout light wave, in a manner similar to a standard hologram, to yield the desired optical wavefront. Although CGH-based display systems can be built today, their high cost makes them impractical for many applications. However, as computer power and optical hardware costs decrease, CGH displays will become a viable alternative in the near future. © 2005 IEEE.},

              Abstract
              In a computer-generated holographic projection system, the image is reconstructed via the diffraction of light from a spatial light modulator. In this process, several factors could contribute to non-linearities between the reconstructed and the target image. This paper evaluates the non-linearity of the overall holographic projection system experimentally, using binary phase holograms computed using the one-step phase retrieval (OSPR) algorithm, and then applies a digital pre-distortion (DPD) method to correct for the non-linearity. Both a notable increase in reconstruction quality and a significant reduction in mean squared error were observed, proving the effectiveness of the proposed DPD-OSPR algorithm.

The proposed technique called Multi-Frame Holograms Batched Optimization uses the L-BFGS optimization algorithm to simultaneously generate a batch of binary phase holograms which result in an average reconstructed image of improved fidelity and fast algorithmic convergence, both in the Fraunhoffer and the Fresnel regimes. The results are compared to One-Step Phase-Retrieval and Adaptive One-Step Phase-Retrieval in simulation and experimentally, proving the superiority of the proposed approach.

Current driver assistance systems such as 2D head-up displays are limited to the projection area on the windshield of the car. An augmented reality holographic point cloud video projection system is developed to display objects aligned with real-life objects in size and distance within the driver's field of view. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data collected with a 3D laser scanner is transformed into layered 3D replay field objects consisting of 400 k points. GPU-accelerated computing generated real-time holograms 16.6 times faster than the CPU processing time. The holographic projections are obtained with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) (3840×2160 px) and virtual Fresnel lenses, which enlarged the driver's eye box to 25 mm × 36 mm. Real-time scanned road obstacles from different perspectives provide the driver a full view of risk factors such as generated depth in 3D mode and the ability to project any scanned object from different angles in 360°. The 3D holographic projection technology allows for maintaining the driver's focus on the road instead of the windshield and enables assistance by projecting road obstacles hidden from the driver's field of view.},

The additive cross-talk between different image planes results in image-quality degradation.

  abstract  = {Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a technique for converting a three-dimensional (3D) object scene into a two-dimensional (2D), complex-valued hologram. One of the major bottlenecks of CGH is the intensive computation that is involved in the hologram generation process. To overcome this problem, numerous research works have been conducted with the aim of reducing arithmetic operations involved in CGH. In this paper, we shall review a number of fast CGH methods that have been developed in the past decade. These methods, which are commonly referred to as point-based CGH, are applied to compute digital Fresnel holograms for an object space that is represented in a point cloud model. While each method has its own strength and weakness, trading off conflicting issues, such as computation efficiency and memory requirement, they also exhibit potential grounds of synergy. We hope that this paper will bring out the essence of each method and provide some insight on how different methods may crossover into better ones.}

However, these systems have been challenged in the past century by modern transportation devices and will be further challenged by virtual environments (VEs) and teleoperator systems. Illusory self-motion within a VE (“cyberspace”) will be entertaining and instructive, but for many users it will result in motion sickness (“cybersickness”). Sensory conflict theory and the poison hypothesis provide an unproven theoretical foundation for understanding the phenomenon. Although no single engineering solution is likely, the problem can be contained by a combination of engineering design, equipment calibration, and exposure management.},

abstract = {To answer the question: “what is 3D good for?” we reviewed the body of literature concerning the performance implications of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) displays versus non-stereo (2D or monoscopic) displays. We summarized results of over 160 publications describing over 180 experiments spanning 51years of research in various fields including human factors psychology/engineering, human–computer interaction, vision science, visualization, and medicine. Publications were included if they described at least one task with a performance-based experimental evaluation of an S3D display versus a non-stereo display under comparable viewing conditions. We classified each study according to the experimental task(s) of primary interest: (a) judgments of positions and/or distances; (b) finding, identifying, or classifying objects; (c) spatial manipulations of real or virtual objects; (d) navigation; (e) spatial understanding, memory, or recall and (f) learning, training, or planning. We found that S3D display viewing improved performance over traditional non-stereo (2D) displays in 60% of the reported experiments. In 15% of the experiments, S3D either showed a marginal benefit or the results were mixed or unclear. In 25% of experiments, S3D displays offered no benefit over non-stereo 2D viewing (and in some rare cases, harmed performance). From this review, stereoscopic 3D displays were found to be most useful for tasks involving the manipulation of objects and for finding/identifying/classifying objects or imagery. We examine instances where S3D did not support superior task performance. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to various fields of research concerning stereoscopic displays within the context of the investigated tasks.}

    abstract = { Depth information from focus cues—accommodation and the gradient of retinal blur—is typically incorrect in three-dimensional (3-D) displays because the light comes from a planar display surface. If the visual system incorporates information from focus cues into its calculation of 3-D scene parameters, this could cause distortions in perceived depth even when the 2-D retinal images are geometrically correct. In Experiment 1 we measured the direct contribution of focus cues to perceived slant by varying independently the physical slant of the display surface and the slant of a simulated surface specified by binocular disparity (binocular viewing) or perspective/texture (monocular viewing). In the binocular condition, slant estimates were unaffected by display slant. In the monocular condition, display slant had a systematic effect on slant estimates. Estimates were consistent with a weighted average of slant from focus cues and slant from disparity/texture, where the cue weights are determined by the reliability of each cue. In Experiment 2, we examined whether focus cues also have an indirect effect on perceived slant via the distance estimate used in disparity scaling. We varied independently the simulated distance and the focal distance to a disparity-defined 3-D stimulus. Perceived slant was systematically affected by changes in focal distance. Accordingly, depth constancy (with respect to simulated distance) was significantly reduced when focal distance was held constant compared to when it varied appropriately with the simulated distance to the stimulus. The results of both experiments show that focus cues can contribute to estimates of 3-D scene parameters. Inappropriate focus cues in typical 3-D displays may therefore contribute to distortions in perceived space. },

abstract = { Those observing the proliferation of three-dimensional (3D) films in US theaters wonder whether 3D will become ‘the new normal’ – the way that most films are produced and watched. Although skeptics abound, no one can answer this question with certainty now. But, if we consider this phrase from a different angle, it promises a more immediately revealing analysis of contemporary 3D cinema. Despite its appearance of born-again novelty, 3D has quickly established a highly codified stylistic repertoire. This repertoire is evidenced in the relationship that 3D US feature films have to classical Hollywood and contemporary film and image-making strategies. As it achieves its spatial effects, 3D obeys, wrestles with, and amplifies certain standard aspects of storytelling, visual style, and genre. Studying recent movies, including blockbusters, this article argues that 3D’s mixture of media heritages distills a highly conventionalized 3D aesthetic or a new stylistic normal. }
